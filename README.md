# Project Proposal

## The Process

I came up with three different project proposals. While brainstorming for ideas, I wanted to maximize the emphasis on learning every aspect of development this course offers since I am a beginner to Software Engineering. This is why all my project proposals can lead to similar end results, no matter which project I actually decide to work on. 

## Proposal 1 - Sociel Media Clone

This is the most basic proposal I offer. I will explain the idea using a Q/A template to keep this and the following proposals concise.

### What?

Exactly what the title implies: I want to create a clone of any popular social media app like Instagram or Facebook.

### Why?

What better way to learn Software Engineering than to obtain hands-on experience developing the most popular softwares out there? The problem here is that I do not know how to make any software. The solution and why this is an important idea is that after having implemented this, I (and my teammates) will be competent in their practices as Software Engineers.

### For whom?

It would be fun having your own little social media app that your friends and family can use. Showcasing this app to other junior CS students aspring to be software engineers will also highly motivate and help them in their learning experience. 

### How?

I want to include as many functionalities as the app being cloned has in the limited time and resources we have for the duration of this course. Examples include a chat system, media sharing capabilities, and video/image editing. 


### Scope

In the end, it does not matter whether or not the clone is perfect. What matters is the learning experience in this proposal. Considering that we make significant progress and do our best, there is no way 4-6 programmers can find this project overwhelming or, more importantly, boring.  



## Proposal 2 - Software Marketplace

A little more on the creative side, I think.

### What?

I want to create a system that allows people to showcase their software to people around the world in order to gain exposure and for entrepreneurship endeavors. 

### Why?

It is important for us to be able to showcase our work and view other people's works in order to grow in our practices and gain feedback from investors/viewers for further improvement. Such a system can make it very accessible for people to sell/buy software of all kinds, for all needs and purposes, in just one place.

### For whom?

For all software engineers, businesses, investors, recruitors etc. 

### How?

A list of functionalities could include:
- Upload your software for sale or on auction (I envision an eBay-esque system).
- Buy or bid on softwares you like.
- Chat with potential buyers or software developers based on each software listing on the system.

### Scope

This project idea is also very basic. The quality of the end-product can be high enough to make this a startup idea or just keep it as a good learning experience on your portfolio. It depends on the worth the team associates with the idea.



## Proposal 3 - Stock Assets Library

Free stuff.

### What?

I want to create a library of stock media - images, videos, audios etc. 

### Why?

To make stock, free content easily available to creators so that they may avoid copyright infringement issues. 

### For whom?

For marketing teams of businesses and for content creators of all scopes. 

### How?

A regularly updated library of stock assets with the following functionalities:
- Download any asset in the system.
- Add and view reviews for every asset. Especially helpful if people are not sure if the listed asset is going to be engaging for their target audience.
- A "recommended" section based on your searches on the system which shows you content you are likely to search for.
- A personal library of assets you have used.
- A showcasing capability of HOW you have used the assets - posters you made with the asset, videos you made etc. - to allow exposure to individuals.

### Scope

Perhaps the most basic idea I have here - just a library. The amount of assets the team adds could vary and the functionalities I listed make the project a good learning experience to compensate for the basic premise.
